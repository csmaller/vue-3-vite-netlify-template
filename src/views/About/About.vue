          USAT certified triathlon coach As a USAT certified coach, Training peaks Level II coach and multiple IM
          athlete, I create training plans that work around an athletes life. I believe hard work pays off but
          over-training is never the answer. I develop training plans that are unique to the athletes needs based on
          their current fitness level, past race experiences, lifestyle, race goals and injuries. Communication with my
          athletes is pivotal to their success so when they show up on the start line they know that their training has
          prepared them for race day.

          I work with athletes all over the US, from every economic and social background. I train athletes who are
          doing their very first sprint to Ironman World Championships. Each athlete is treated with the same care a
          detail that is needed for their personal goals!

        <h4>FAMILY BACKGROUND</h4>
        <p>
          Growing up in South Florida I have been in the fitness industry for almost 25 years. As a child and young
          adult, I didn't have the opportunity to play in organized sports. Being the oldest of three girls in a single
          parent family my responsibilities and lack of money didn't allow me to enjoy sports in school this is likely
          the reason that I committed to making fitness my life after school.
